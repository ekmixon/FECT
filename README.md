Fast Evidence Collector Toolkit is a light incident response toolkit to collect evidences on a suspicious Windows computer.
Basically it is intended to be used by non-tech savvy people working with a journeyman Incident Handler.

It uses Microsoft autorunsc to identify binaries launched at windows startup and zip all the binaries to a zip archive.
It looks for all .exe/.com/.dll/.scr in users' home directories and add them to the zipball.
It also logs the output of some interesting network commands.

Finally the zip archive is xored to evade from AV.

## Development status

**FECT is no longer maintained**

## How to install

Just copy all files from github

## Dependencies

* pywin32 - http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/
* py2exe - http://www.py2exe.org/
* Microsoft Visual C runtime DLL See: http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial#Step5

## How to build

Edit FECT.py and fill the autorunsc_exe_hex_encoded variable with a hex encoded version of the autorunsc binary.
You can use the provided pyBinHexEncoder.py script to generate it.

Then type:
python setup py2exe

## How to run

Just double click on it :) 

If there is not Microsoft Visual C runtime DLL on the suspicious computer, you must add the Microsoft.VC90.CRT directory (containing both Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest and msvcr90.dll) in the same directory as FECT.exe

Default options passed to autorunsc are '-a -c -m -f' i.e. all entries with the respective hashes, except the one from Microsoft, output format is CSV.

FECT also acts as a wrapper for autorunsc. You can pass any specific options you want by using the -a option.
E.g.: FECT.py -a \"-b -s -c -f\"

Beware: double quotes are Mandatory. -c is mandatory as well.

Finally use pyXoredBinEn-Decoder.py to unXor the zipball.
